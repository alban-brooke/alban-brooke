    <h1>What I'd like this site to be</h1>
    <p>I'd like to make a website where I could write about books, podcasts, and marketing for SaaS products.</p>
    <p>Cal Newport and <a href="https://iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2018_Spring_Jacobs.php">Alan Jacobs</a> both make great arguments for having your own domain and controlling yourself. I'd really like to create a site without a CMS so that the site was ultra-fast and clean.</p>
