    <h1>What I'd like to create</h1>
    <p>I'd really like to make a website where I could write blog posts about digital marketing and growth for SaaS products. I'm a big fan of Cal Newport and Alan Jacobs, so I'd like to put this on a domain that I'm controlling myself rather than writing on Medium. It would be really cool to do it without a CMS so that it was ultra-fast and clean.</p>
    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>If I'm going to have more than one blog post every few three months, I'll probably have to post about the books I'm reading. Here are the books I've read in 2019:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Atomic Habits, by James Clear</li>
        <li>A Land Remembered, by Patrick D. Smith</li>
        <li>The Power of Habit, by Charles Duhigg</li>
        <li>Mountains Beyond Mountains, by Tracy Kidder</li>
      </ul>
  </body>
